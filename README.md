# My project

## First steps

- Install dependencies using `yarn` or `npm i`
- Launch the backend with `yarn dev`
- If you change any model, run the migrations with `yarn migrate:save` and `yarn migrate:up`
- Apply the new migrations to the prisma client with `yarn generate`
- Prisma has an IDE for the database. Launch it with `yarn studio`
